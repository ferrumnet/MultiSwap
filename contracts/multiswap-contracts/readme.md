# MultiSwap Documentation
MultiSwap contracts are structured into two main categories:

## MultiSwap Contracts:
### FiberRouter
- Facilitates the execution of token swaps and interacts with various DEX aggregators, such as 1inch, Uniswap, and SushiSwap. All user interactions go through this contract. Functions beginning with `swap` are called by the user on the source chain, with functions beginning with `withdraw` are called by Ferrum's node infrastructure on the destination chain.

### FeeDistributor
- `FeeDistributor` is designed to handle the distribution of transaction fees collected from swaps. This contract ensures that fees are distributed to various stakeholders according to predefined allocations. These allocations are determined in Ferrum's backend, with on-chain signature verification for the passed amounts.

### Fundmanager
- Manages the funds (liquidity pool) and provides functionalities for fund management. Intended to mainly be called by system admin, though there is a facility for anyone to be a liquidity provider.

### CCTPFundmanager
- Serves a similar function to the base FundManager implementation, but targetting compatability with Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP). Funds are typically only held for short durations, as CCTP does not require a sustained liquidity pool.

### LiquidityManagerRole**
- Handles liquidity management with designated roles. It provides mechanisms to add or remove liquidity under strict role-based permissions.

## Forge/Gas Estimation Contracts:
### MultiSwapForge
- Inherits from `fiberRouter` and is used only for gas estimation on the destination chain side by simulating withdrawal transactions. The gas consumption is then used to estimate fees for the withdraw side.

### ForgeFundManager
- Inherits from `fundManager` and serves the same as above.

### ForgeCCTPFundManager
- Inherits from `CCTPFundManager` and serves the same as above.

# FiberRouter Contract Documentation

## Overview
`FiberRouter.sol` is a key component of the MultiSwap project designed for handling token swaps both within a single network and across different networks, with the possibility of using CCTP. This contract facilitates efficient token swapping mechanisms, manages gas fee payments, and ensures secure transaction processing through a router whitelist system.

## Inherits
- Inherits `Ownable`: Ensures that administrative functions are protected and can only be accessed by the contract owner.
- Inherits `TokenReceivable`: Primarily aimed towards managing balances for fee-on-transfer tokens.
- Inherits `FeeDistributor`: Distributes transaction fees.

## Using Libraries
- **SafeERC20 for IERC20**
  - This contract uses the `SafeERC20` library which provides safety checks when interacting with ERC20 tokens. These checks prevent common mistakes like failing to handle return values in token transfer operations.

## State Variables

### Public Variables
- **weth:** `address public`
  - Address of the Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) token contract. This is used for operations that require Ethereum in an ERC20 format.
- **fundManager:** `address public`
  - Address of the Fund Manager contract that manages and orchestrates the handling of funds within various operations.
- **cctpFundManager:** `address public`
  - Address of the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) Fund Manager. This contract handles the management of cross-chain CCTP transfers.
- **gasWallet:** `address payable public`
  - The wallet address designated for receiving and managing ETH used to pay for transaction gas costs.

### Private Variables
- **routerAllowList:** `mapping(bytes32 => bool) private`
  - A mapping that stores whether a specific router and selector combination is allowed (whitelisted) to perform operations like swaps. It is used to enhance security by ensuring only authorized routers can execute certain functions.

### Public Mappings
- **targetNetworks:** `mapping(uint256 => TargetNetwork) public`
  - A mapping from network identifiers (chain IDs) to `TargetNetwork` structs. This helps manage and configure operations that involve cross-network interactions, storing necessary details about each supported network.
